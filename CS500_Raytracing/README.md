### CS500: Raytracing
This is a ray-tracing class I took during Fall of 2019. It's a completely software based ray-tracing class with an emphasis on mathematics.
There were five projects in total: the first three built on top of each other; the fourth was a full path tracer; and the fifth project was a custom addition to either the third or fourth projects.

I'm currently in the process of cleaning the majority of the projects, as I didn't completely finish them during the semester. I'm proud the second project as I got it 100% correct. I will upload the remaining projects once they are ready.
